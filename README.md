### Visual Studio Code Development Environment

This project contains the following Visual Studio CodeÂ (a.k.a. VS Code) configuration files to make it easy to start developing.

* [Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration files in [.devcontainer](.devcontainer)
* [Run/Debug (Launch)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) configuration file in [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json)

Please be sure that the following required software is installed on your workstation.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [VS Code's Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Clone this repository to your workstation and open it in VS Code.

When you open the project folder in VS Code you should see a notification in the bottom, right saying `Folder contains a Development Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container`. Clicking the `Reopen in Container` button tells VS Code to build the development container image, start the container and connect to it for development. If you do not see the notification you can open the list of remote commands by clicking on the green section on the bottom, left side of the status bar and then selecting `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

It will take some time for VS Code to build, start and connect to the development container the first time you open the project but subsequent usage will be much faster.

VS Code should now be connected to development container with all the tools and settings necessary to build and test this project. If your workflow uses VS Code extensions that are not installed in the development container by default (e.g. eamodio.gitlens, github.vscode-pull-request-github) you can add them to the list of extensions in [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and rebuild the development container.

The provided [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) configuration file contains a configuration named `configure-accounts` for running/debugging the `vault-util configure-accounts` command and a configuration named `fetch-secret-env` for running/debugging the `vault-util fetch-secret-env` command. These are configured to connect to our `vault.es.chef.co` server. If you want to use either of these you will need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace `vault-token` with your vault token. You can view your vault token by running `vault print token`. Also, be sure to properly set `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_NAMESPACE` in the [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) configuration file.

If you make changes to files in the `.devcontainer` folder you might need to rebuild the development container by selecting `Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container` from the list of remote commands.

When you are done using the development container you can stop it by simply closing the project's VS Code window or you can select `Remote-Containers: Reopen Locally` from the list of remote commands.
